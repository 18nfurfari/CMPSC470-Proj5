Nicolas Furfari and David Atkins worked in a group together on this assignment.

We imported the java.util.ArrayList and java.util.HasMap libraries for Env.java.

To compile the Lexer.flex file, we opened the jflex-1.6.1.jar and entered the Lexer.flex file location, and the same directory
to output the compiled Lexer.java file to.

To compile the Parser.y file, we ran the command yacc -J Parser.y in the console in the project directory.

To compile the program, we uncommented the "args = new String[] { "test\\test1.minc" };" line and entered the path for each
test file there.
